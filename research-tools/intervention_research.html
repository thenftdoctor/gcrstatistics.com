        <h4>Why perform an intervention study?</h4>
        <p>
          The aim of intervention research is to compare the effects of different treatments.
          <b>We want to know which treatments work best for which patients, in terms of efficacy</b> (benefit in symptom reduction, quality of life, specific functions, survival) and <b>adverse effects</b> (toxicity, complications).
          <b>randomization ensures comparability of treatment groups, which is the key to causal inference between treatment and outcome.</b>
          In order to establish the standard-of-care, new therapies need to be validated.
          This validation process differs between drugs and (surgical) interventions.
          See the next section for further elaboration.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row py-2">
        <h4>What types of diagnostic studies are there?</h4>
        <p>
          We can roughly divide intervention research trials into:<br>
          - Drug trials<br>
          - Surgical/intervention/psychotherapy trials
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row py-2">
        <h4>What about drug trials?</h4>
        <p>
          Drug trials typically follow these phases:<br><br>
          - <b>Phase 0: Pilot/exploration trial.</b>
            These studies are typically performed in a handful of patients (often healthy volunteers who will not benefit from the treatment).
            The aim of these studies is to evaluate whether the drug does what it is supposed to do.<br>
          - <b>Phase 1: Safety study.</b>
            This is typically a prospective cohort study in which dose-escalation is performed in patients to determine the maximum tolerable dose and describe the safety profile ([serious] adverse events are noted).<br>
          - <b>Phase 2: Safety study.</b>
            This is typically a prospective cohort study in which patients with the disease (often less then 100) are treated with the drug in the maximum tolerable dose to demonstrate treatment efficacy. The researchers need to define efficacy ahead of time (for example a response rate of 40% or median overall survival of 1 year).<br>
          - <b>Phase 3: Comparative trial.</b>
            This phase is the hallmark of intervention research.
            This is the time to compare the treatment efficacy and/or safety of the new drug with that of the standard-of-care (pragmatic trial) or a placebo (explanatory trial) in a randomized controlled trial.
            Most studies are designed to demonstrate superior efficacy of the new drug over the standard-of-care (superiority trial). Some trials however, aim to demonstrate equal efficacy (non-inferiority trial).
            In the latter case, the novel drug should have another benefit (less adverse events, cheaper etc.).<br>
          - <b>Phase 4: Post-marketing testing/registry study</b>
            After a succesful phase 3 trial, most drugs can enter the market (with regulatory approval).
            Some things still need to be evaluated, requiring a large number of patients and a longer period of follow-up.
            Typically, a registry study is performed to record rare adverse events and determine added/reduced benefit in patient subgroups.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row py-2">
        <h4>What about surgical and interventional trials?</h4>
        <p>
          The validation of (surgical) interventions is more complex.
          This is attributable to the operator dependency (difference in strategies, learning effect) and high costs (both financially and time).
          The IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up – improving the quality of research in surgery) collaboration has described the following phases for these types of studies:<br><br>
          - <b>Phase 1: Idea</b>
            In this phase, the innovator of a novel procedure tries to establish proof-of-principle (often times focused on technical succes) in a handful of patients (comparable to phase 0 drug trial).<br>
          - <b>Phase 2a: Development</b>
            The procedure is developed and refined in a few selected patients in a prospective development study. It is essential to describe all sequentially treated patients, adaptations to the procedure, complications and potential benefits.<br>
          - <b>Phase 2b: Exploration</b>
            In this phase, the procedure should become standardised so that it can be performed by a growing number of operators in an increasing number of patients. A prospective research database can be used to evaluate learning curves, further refine the procedure, identify optimal candidates for the treatment and assess benefits and adverse effects of treatment. In this stage, a small RCT can be performed to evaluate the feasibility of a large RCT.<br>
          - <b>Phase 3: Assessment</b>
            Comparable to phase 3 comparative drug trial.<br>
          - <b>Phase 4: Long-term study</b>
            Comparable to phase 4 post-marketing drug study.<br>

        <h4>What are the differences in study design</h4>
        <p>
          - For phase 0-2 trials, a <b>prospective cohort study</b> is recommended. A so-called exact group sequential design with predefined stopping boundaries may be required.<br>
          - A ‘standard RCT’ is called a <b>parallel group randomized trial</b>.<br>
          - If the goal is to demonstrate that the novel therapy works just as well as another therapy, it is called a <b>non-inferiority trial</b>.
          Key to this study design is defining a range of difference in outcome ahead of time that can be regarded as negligible.
          - If the comparator treatment is a placebo (or sham procedure), the trial is called an <b>explanatory trial</b>.
          It is not always necessary or desirable to use a placebo.
          First of all, there’s a placebo effect in every treatment given in clinical practice (usually beneficial).
          Second of all, it is usually more informative to compare the efficacy and toxicity with the standard-of-care (a <b>pragmatic trial</b>).<br>
          - <b>Within-patient-randomized controlled trials</b> use the study subject as his/her own control.
          A well-known type is the before-and-after study, where certain functions or symptoms are measured before and after 1 therapy or multiple therapies.
          In locoregional interventions, an organ may be split into multiple study parts (for example two eyes/ears/lungs/kidneys/liver lobes or multiple teeth).
          This can be a very efficient study design, but there are many considerations to take into account.<br>
          - A trial that compares multiple treatments or treatment regimens (for example different doses or combinations of therapies) is called a <b>factorial randomized controlled trial</b>.<br>
          - A <b>propensity score matched study</b> is a non-randomized intervention study design.
          A randomized trial is preferred, but not always feasible. In a propensity score study, two different treatment cohorts can be compared after assigning a propensity score – based on his/her baseline characteristics – to each individual.
          Consequently individuals with equal propensity scores can be compared.<br><br>

      <div class="row py-2">
        <h4>What are the biggest challenges in diagnostic research?</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Feasibility.</b>
           Large randomized controlled trials are very expensive, labour- and time-intensive.
           Many drug or medical device companies initiate or sponsor RCT’s, thereby helping out with the feasibility aspect.
           It is, however, important that potential conflicts of interest (science vs. profit) do not interfere with the ethics of proper scientific evaluation.<br><br>
          <b>Adjusting for confounding variables.</b>
           randomization should take care of confounding variables.
           However, especially in somewhat smaller trials, differences in baseline characteristics may persist after randomization.
           Stratified randomization and adjusted multivariable analysis can help solve this problem.<br><br>
          <b>Selective dropout and treatment cross-over.</b>
          Patients may wish to leave the study early due to adverse events or other factors (selective dropout).
          Furthermore, some patients may receive the standard-of-care treatment after refusal or the experimental treatment failed (cross-over).
          This leads to a problem in the analysis. If we analyse the patients just as they were randomized (intention-to-treat analysis), we are not really comparing the effects of the treatment that they actually received.
          Often times this leads to a dilution of the estimated experimental treatment effect.
          However, we do maintain the between-group balance created by the randomization.
          If on the other hand, we were to analyse patients according to the treatment that they actually received (per protocol analysis) we break the between-group balance.
          Don’t selectively report the most beneficial scenario at the end of the study. You should make the decision ahead of time and stick to the plan, or report both analyses.<br><br>
          <b>Many different outcome types are used.</b>
          Overall survival is generally regarded as the most robust and meaningful outcome type.
          Sometimes, for example in terminal cancer patients, quality of life is more important.
          Often times trials use surrogate endpoints (for example tumour response rate, serum biomarker level, time-to-progression/progression-free survival) because this requires less patients.
          If you use a surrogate endpoint for this reason, make sure that the surrogate endpoint has a very strong association with the actual endpoint of interest.
          Other trials, especially those in the cerebro/cardio-vascular domain, use composite endpoints (for example: stroke, cardiac event or death).
          The availability of multiple trials with different outcomes in one clinical setting makes it difficult to compare results.<br><br>
          <b>Limited window of clinical equipoise.</b>
          Equipoise is the situation in which there is uncertainty to which treatment is better.
          If a novel treatment is promising and receives a lot of media attention, people may not want to receive the standard-of-care anymore.
          Furthermore, due to the rapid innovation cycle, the standard-of-care may be updated during the time it takes to conduct a large RCT.<br>

        <h4>How to get started?</h4>
